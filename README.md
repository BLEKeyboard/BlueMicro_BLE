Top Row: 5x5Backpack, 4x4Backpack

Bottom Row: BlueMicro V2.0,  BlueMicro V1.0, BlueNano V2.0, BlueNano V1.0, Pro Micro (For Reference)

* [Adafruit nRF52 Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3406) (Software compatible)
* [BlueMicro V1.0](https://github.com/jpconstantineau/NRF52-Board/tree/master/EByte_E73)  Serial TX/RX routed through D2 and D3; Designed for the ErgoTravel; Tested and Gerber available
* [BlueMicro V1.1](https://github.com/jpconstantineau/NRF52-Board/tree/master/EByte_E73)  Compatible with more Keyboards - Serial TX/RX are routed separately; Tested and Gerber available
* [BlueMicro V2.0b](https://github.com/jpconstantineau/NRF52-Board/tree/master/EByte_E73_Batt) Compatible with more Keyboards - Serial TX/RX are routed separately, LiPo Charger on board; Tested and Gerber available 
* [BlueMicro V2.0c](https://github.com/jpconstantineau/NRF52-Board/tree/master/EByte_E73_Batt_ErgoTravel) Serial TX/RX routed through D2 and D3; Designed for the ErgoTravel. LiPo Charger on Board with battery connection connected to RAW pin. Tested and Gerber available.
* [BlueMicro840]() Bluemicro based on the design of the nrfmicro.  Still being worked on...

* [4x4 Backpack](https://github.com/jpconstantineau/NRF52-Board/tree/master/4x4_backpack/4x4_backpack) For use with [40percent.club 4x4 Boards](https://www.40percent.club/2018/01/4x4x4x4x4.html). Uses a CR2032 Battery.
* [4x4 Platform](https://github.com/jpconstantineau/NRF52-Board/tree/master/4x4_backpack/4x4_platform) For use with [40percent.club 4x4 Boards](https://www.40percent.club/2018/01/4x4x4x4x4.html). Uses a rechargeable Battery, has a single RGB on board and has a few status LEDs and PWM driven LEDs. Has serial on board too!
* [4x4 Backpack840](https://github.com/jpconstantineau/NRF52-Board/tree/master/4x4_backpack/4x4_backpack_nrf52840) For use with [40percent.club 4x4 Boards](https://www.40percent.club/2018/01/4x4x4x4x4.html). Uses a rechargeable  Battery, has a single RGB on board and has a few status LEDs and PWM driven LEDs.  Most importantly, it uses a nrf52840 module instead of a nrf52832 module.

* [5x5 Backpack](https://github.com/jpconstantineau/NRF52-Board/tree/master/5x5_backpack/5x5_backpack) For use with [40percent.club 5x5 Boards](https://www.40percent.club/2018/04/5x5.html). Uses a CR2032 Battery.

* BLE Phage       (Compatible with even more Keyboards due to its small size - Serial USB and PoLi Charger on board)
* [BLE Phage Basic](https://southpawdesign.net/products/blue-phage-basic?variant=8958741545020) (Compatible with even more Keyboards due to its small size - Serial TX/RX are routed separately)

# Credits

The firmware uses the same Arduino Core as the [Adafruit nRF52 Feather Boards](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino)

The Adafruit NRF52 Arduino Core is based on [Arduino-nRF5](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-nRF5) by Sandeep Mistry, which in turn is based on the [Arduino SAMD Core](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-samd).

The following tools are used:

- Arduino IDE as the Editing Environment
- GCC ARM Embedded as the compiler
- Nordic's nrfutil 0.5.2 for flashing the firmware by serial interface
- J-Link for flashing the bootloader by SWD interface
